*(and occasionally embarrass myself at karting tracks)*

📍 **Redmond, WA** — Bellevue Hub regular

🎓 **MS Computer Science** — Arizona State University

🏎️ **Fun fact** — Huge F1 fan. Yes I do think I could beat my teammates in a kart. No I have not been proven wrong yet.

## My Journey
| | Role | What I did | Vibe |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🔬 | **LEAPS Lab @ ASU** | Built backend for power systems optimizations + led AI initiatives |
| 📦 | **Microsoft DevBox** | Joined Dec 2025 — onboarding, getting access, filing more tickets to get more access |
| ⚡ | **GitHub Actions C&S** | Came over with the team in the reorg — and honestly could not be happier about it |

## 🚀 What I've Shipped
| Feature | Repos |  |
|---|---|---|
| 🖼️ Runner pool image editing | github, github-ui, launch, actions-dotnet | if you change your mind later? I got you |
| 📸 Snapshot versioning | actions-proto, actions-broker-worker, actions-run-service, actions-dotnet | Atleast support will now know you tried to sneak in the "snapshot" keyword |
| 🧹 Feature flag cleanup | github | I said "Clean-up", and my my mom was already proud |

**22 PRs across 9 repos** *(anyone else weirdly obsessed with green tiles?)*
